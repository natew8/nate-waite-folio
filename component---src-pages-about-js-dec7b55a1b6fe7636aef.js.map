From\n          music to science, from theatre to web development, I live for the\n          magic that comes from making something that real person can enjoy.\n        </p>\n        <p className={aboutStyles.pB}>\n          As a kid growing up in a musical family, I very early on became\n          heavily involved in music and singing. I picked up the guitar when i\n          was 11 and never put it down. From middle school all the way through\n          highschool and early college my days were filled with music and\n          theatre.\n        </p>\n        <p className={aboutStyles.pA}>\n          In my first few semesters of college studying musical theatre I\n          decided that my true calling was in music production. I changed\n          schools, changed degrees, and changed my focus. I started teaching\n          myself how to produce music. With some incredible help along the way,\n          I was able to go from knowing nothing about music production to\n          executive producing a charting RnB album in 4 years.\n        </p>\n        <p className={aboutStyles.pB}>\n          During those years I also met someone who changed my life forever.\n          Kaylie, has become the supporting pillar in my whole world. We have\n          two boys, Bash and Lucas, who make our world better every day.\n          Everything I do is for them.\n        </p>\n        <p className={aboutStyles.pA}>\n          My Web development journey started only recently but has quickly\n          become one of the best decisions I've ever made. Not only have I\n          acquired extremely relevant and real world skills but I have found\n          another avenue to produce something that can change the world. I love\n          to code. I get to take ones and zeros and turn them into something you\n          can experience in the real world.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default about\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nmodule.exports = {\"about\":\"about-module--about--2y0QB\",\"pA\":\"about-module--pA--24-k1\",\"pB\":\"about-module--pB--1zzPD\"};"],"sourceRoot":""}
